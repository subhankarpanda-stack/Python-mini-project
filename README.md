Student Result Management System (CLI Based)
Project Overview-
The Student Result Management System is a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) based Python project that allows users to manage student academic records.
This system enables users to:
1.Add student details
2.Calculate total marks and percentage
3.Assign grades automatically
4.View all student records
5.Search for a student by roll number

It is designed to demonstrate fundamental Python concepts such as:
Functions
Lists
Dictionaries
Conditional statements
Loops
User input handling

Features-
✔ Add new student records
✔ Automatically calculate total marks
✔ Automatically calculate percentage
✔ Automatically assign grades (A, B, C, Fail)
✔ View all stored student records
✔ Search student by roll number
✔ Menu-driven CLI interface

Technologies Used-
Python 3

Command Line Interface (CLI)-
Project Structure

README.md

How It Works-
Add Student
Enter student name
Enter roll number
Enter marks for 3 subjects
System calculates:
Total Marks
Percentage
Grade (Based on percentage)

Grading Criteria-
Percentage	Grade
90 and above	A
75 – 89	B
50 – 74	C
Below 50	Fail

2.View All Students
Displays all stored student records in dictionary format.

3.Search Student
Searches a student record using the roll number.

How to Run the Project

Concepts Practiced
Python functions
List operations
Dictionary usage
Conditional logic (if-elif-else)
While loop
Basic data validation
CLI program structure

Future Improvements-
Store data permanently using file handling
Add update & delete functionality
Add input validation
Use OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
Create GUI version using Tkinter
Convert into a web-based application
